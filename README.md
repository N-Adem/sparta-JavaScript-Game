# sparta-JavaScript-Game

Purpose - The purpose of the web game development task was presented so that it would provide me with an opportunity 
to practice what i'd learnt so far in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This prohect is intended to demonstrate
my current capabilities in a well rounded project, which tests my creative design skills followed by my programme design and 
execution. 

(This game is a working progress and will be updated - new releases will be published in this README file). 

1. Project Overview
- The game concept has been finalised. (The concept involves a charactrer which the user is able to control. Who travels 
around an environment removing as many puddles as possible).

2. Functionality
- The game player controls are w,a,s,d which move the player up, down, left, and right.
- The gameplay requires the player (the white roll), to go over the puddles to remove them 
and gain points until the puddles stop spawning.


3. Implementation 
- The game has been built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript 
- It was implememnted predominantly in JavaScript using the OOP principles.

4. Running 
- The project curerently runs on the web in full size. 
(A further scaleable feature will be added in due time).
 
 5. Current issues which are currently being updated are - the player isn't able to go back to the menu page upon completing the game,
and the spawning system isn't as natural as expected. 

*New* - Update will be released on 03/02/2019)
